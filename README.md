# double-pendulum


'sim_double_pendulum.py' creates animation for given parameters and initial conditions
'sim_double_fractal_initial_conditions.py' runs simulations for a grid of initial coniditions (number of grid points determined by gridlength L) and colors grid point if lower half of the pendulum "flips" over at least once in given simulation time. Plots are generated in "Plots" folder.
